## My Process

- I started out with the HTML structuring of the order summary card. Positioning the image, texts and buttons.
- Followed it up with styling each element to mimic what was presented in the challenge design files with CSS.

## Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS3 custom properties
- Flexbox

## What I learned

- Improved ability working with CSS Flexbox
- CSS [overflow:hidden;] : Used to get illustration-hero.svg image to take the border radius of the parent div
- Centering elements horizontally and vertically with [display:flex;], [margin:0 auto], [position:relative;], [position:absolute;]
- Tint image with linear gradient

## Continued Development

- Looking forward to taking up a few more HTML & CSS challenges before later moving on to JS.
